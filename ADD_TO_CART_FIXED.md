## 🔧 ISSUES IDENTIFIED & FIXED

### 1. ❌ CORS Issues (CRITICAL) → ✅ RESOLVED
**Problem:** Direct browser calls to Shopify API blocked by CORS policy  
**Solution:** Implemented comprehensive server-side proxy endpoints  
**Files Fixed:**
- `server/routes.ts` - Added proxy endpoints: `/api/shopify/*`
- `client/src/lib/shopify.ts` - Updated to use proxy instead of direct API calls

### 2. ❌ Duplicate Import Compilation Error → ✅ RESOLVED  
**Problem:** Duplicate React imports causing TypeScript compilation errors  
**Solution:** Removed duplicate import statements  
**Files Fixed:**
- `client/src/hooks/use-shopify.tsx` - Fixed duplicate `useState`/`useEffect` imports

### 3. ❌ Invalid Product Variant ID → ✅ RESOLVED
**Problem:** Hardcoded product variant ID didn't exist in the store  
**Solution:** Found and updated to valid product variant ID  
**Updated Configuration:**
- Old: `gid://shopify/ProductVariant/8054005071919`
- New: `gid://shopify/ProductVariant/41068385009711`

### 4. ❌ Incorrect GraphQL Query Structure → ✅ RESOLVED
**Problem:** Using `productVariant(id:)` directly instead of `node(id:)` pattern  
**Solution:** Updated GraphQL queries to use proper Shopify Storefront API syntax  
**Files Fixed:**
- `server/routes.ts` - Fixed both test-connection and health-check endpoints

### 5. ❌ Windows PowerShell Compatibility → ✅ RESOLVED
**Problem:** npm scripts and environment variables not working in Windows PowerShell  
**Solution:** Added cross-env package and updated scripts  
**Files Fixed:**
- `package.json` - Updated dev script with cross-env
- Added cross-env to dependencies
