
We want to develop a custom map builder tool that integrates seamlessly with Shopify. The tool should allow customers to design black-and-white engraved-style maps with specific customization options, preview the final product, and automatically generate production-ready files for our team. The builder must support multiple product types and sizes, connect directly to Shopify checkout, and streamline both the customer and admin workflow.

These examples represent the type of customer flow and customization experience we’re looking for, but we want our solution to be unique and tailored to our products.

File Saving and Transmission
- Save file as a true black-and-white image (no gradients)
-- White = land/text/icons
-- Black = engraved area
- Save file as high-quality JPEG (minimum 8MB, maximum 30MB)
- Must export at 300 DPI resolution for engraving consistency
- File name should include the Shopify order number (e.g., Order12345_Map.jpeg)
